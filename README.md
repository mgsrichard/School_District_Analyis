# School District Analyis

## Overview

Previously, we completed an analysis for a city school system of their students' outcomes in reading and in math. We computed average math and reading scores, and passing rates in math, reading, and overall passing in both subjects.  We presented these results on a city wide basis, individual school basis, by ranges of per capita spending, by school size, and by type of school (district vs. charter schools). Additionally, we provided a list of the top and bottom 5 performing schools. Now, they have contacted us again with concerns about the accuracy of the data from ninth graders at Thomas High School (THS), and asked us to do the analysis again excluding these student's grades. This report summarizes our findings with the scores from THS ninth graders omitted, and discusses the impact of that data change.
